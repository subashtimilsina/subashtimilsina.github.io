I am a third-year PhD student in computer science at Oregon State University, advised by [Dr. Xiao Fu](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~fuxia/). I work on formulating optimization problems for machine learning, developing algorithms, and providing theoretical and identifiability guarantees. My research focuses on `unsupervised representation learning`, particularly matrix and tensor decompositions, `multi-modal learning` from unpaired/unaligned data with content style modeling approaches, and using `generative models` for solving inverse problems. 

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a data scientist at [Docsumo](https://www.docsumo.com/about), where I focused on extracting unstructured data from documents like inovices, bank statements, and tax forms. My work involved computer vision tasks, such as **table detection, template matching with minimal annotations** and natural language processing tasks such as **topic modeling, name entity recognition, and text classifications**.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Pulchowk Campus, IOE, Tribhuvan University, Nepal. During my undergraduate years, I was an active member of the [robotics club at Pulchowk Campus](https://robotics.pcampus.edu.np), where I built robots and represented Nepal in the Asia Pacific Robotics Competition (ABU Robocon).
