I am a third-year PhD student in computer science at Oregon State University, advised by [Dr. Xiao Fu](https://web.engr.oregonstate.edu/~fuxia/). My research focuses on unsupervised representation learning, generative modeling, and multi-view learning.

Before starting my PhD, I worked as a data scientist at [Docsumo](https://www.docsumo.com/about), where I solved problems on computer vision and NLP tasks to extract information from documents.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Electronics and Communication Engineering from Pulchowk Campus, IOE, Tribhuvan University, Nepal. During my undergraduate years, I was an active member of the robotics club at Pulchowk Campus and built robots to compete in the Asia Pacific Robotics Competition (ABU Robocon), representing Nepal.
